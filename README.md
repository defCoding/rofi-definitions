# Rofi Dictionary
A dictionary program that uses Rofi's dMenu as an interface.

## Context
From time to time, I'll get curious about the definition of a word I'll chance upon. To find the definition of the word, I then have to open up a web browser, then type in the search bar "define {word}". That's one step too many. Also I have to wait for the web browser to load up, and that's like *nearly a second*. I could do a lot in a second. Also I needed an excuse to make this program.
